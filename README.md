# Sample Landing Page Built Using Bit & NextJS

This repository contains a template for a website landing page and is designed and maintained by Enlear.

It includes a reusable component library compiled using Bit and a NextJS application to serve the front-end components. 

The `enlear-workspace` directory is the local workspace that we have used to develop the components using Bit. However, we've exported the components to our scope.

The `landing-page-template` directory contains a NextJS project that uses the components designed by Bit

If you plan on customizing the Bit components, you can open the `enlear-workspace` and navigate to the `workspace.jsonc` and update the default scope. Or you can create a new bit workspace and import the components that you need, customize it and export it to your desired scope.
